# Final-Project-Data-Mining
Final project for data mining/machine learning class I took in college. Performed exploratory data analysis and trained machine learning classifiers (KNN, TDIDT, TensorFlow linear evaluator) on a diamond data set, creating a price predictor based on attributes such as diamond color, cut, clarity, and carat.
